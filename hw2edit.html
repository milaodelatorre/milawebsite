<p>I've always been drawn to signage and mundane looking spaces. My contrast preference varies based on the emotion I'm trying to evoke or how easily I want the photo to be read. The first image here has quite a low contrast, because that felt accurate to the 'emotion' of the scene. The second image is much higher in contrast, to guide the viewer's eyes to the sign.</p>
