<p>The journey to the city is rough.</p>
<p>The train feels slower than normal, and someone's eating something stinky.</p>
 <p>You assure your partner you're fine, but as soon as you step out of the station and the parents wave to you, something comes up.</p>
 <p>You throw up, before saying hi, and in front of the restaurant. The host is mortified, your partner is mortified, the parents are mortified.</p> 
<p>In a panic, you decide to just go inside and get seated. Everyone joins, but the meal is uncomfortable and quiet. Afer you all leave, your partner gets a text: "We're not too sure about this one..."</p>
 <h2>You did not win them over.</h2>
