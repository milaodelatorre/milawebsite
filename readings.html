<h3>Susan Sontag, In Plato's Cave</h3>
<p></p>
<p>One of the first lines in In Plato’s Cave describes the human instinct to photograph as “insatiable”, a word that’s been big in my own personal vocabulary lately. I’ve viewed my insatiability as a bad thing – my desire to consume media, food, and material items has felt embarrassing and greedy. But this insatiability has also made me the photographer that I am today. I bought my first film camera five years ago, a result of my desire to introduce a new practice to my life, a new form of collecting. I went through a roll a day, unable to stop myself from photographing my life around me. </p>
<p>To me, taking photos and creating graphics is just giving my eyes to someone else. It’s a way of telling someone, “This is what I find interesting and here’s how it looks to me.” You could place the same object in front of five photographers and five different interpretations of that object will be revealed. As a photographer, I’m biased to this art form over others, and its ability to do this. Photography is one of those tools that isn’t outwardly telling us how to feel or what to think, but it does.</p>
<p>Photography is discussed as a deeply biased form of documentation. To view a photo is to view the world as the person who took that photo. We may think that we take neutral standpoints but every part of building a photo, from the framing to the lighting to the post-production and how we bring the subject to life, is a result of our feelings towards the subject. The photo of Donald Trump, fist raised after being shot, is widely discussed in this context. A far less known photo from the same moment exists, of him being held up, fear in his eyes. The argument here is that the photo of him with his fist raised makes him look strong, undefeatable, more likeable. Photojournalism and using images in combination to represent our world right now is an inherently biased practice. And since images are easier and quicker to consume, they dictate a lot of our subconscious opinions in politics. </p>
<p>Something I disagree with in Sontag’s writing is her saying that photography is an act of non-intervention. “Non-intervention” insinuates an unbiased approach to the subject matter, which is contradictory to my whole approach to and beliefs about photography. She writes that documenting and intervening are things that cannot happen in conjunction. While taking a photo isn’t necessarily an in-the-moment action, the long term effects from an image being shared cannot be pre-determined. The photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc is a really important one to discuss in this context – people have criticized the photographer for not helping her in the moment, but the image was so widespread and is credited as leading to the end of the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Photography is an important and very powerful tool. It humanizes, it unifies, and it speaks without words. </p>

<h3>Nesrine Malik, With 'AI slop' distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</h3>
<p></p>
<p>AI imagery was something that did not concern me a year ago – as a photographer I’ve prided myself in my keen eye. I didn’t feel threatened by the “creation” of an image from a prompt, because there was always something imperfect about the image. For a while, the hands and fingers of figures in AI images were a giveaway. No part of AI imagery felt real enough to ever threaten the human mind. But AI has snowballed in its development and is reaching a point where the lines between real and unreal are more and more blurred. A few months ago I saw a Tiktok of security footage showing a group of bunnies jumping on a trampoline. I love bunnies, I found the video to be incredibly sweet, and I liked it. It was AI. It felt really jarring to get tricked by AI imagery, because I’ve been so set in my belief that it will never replace real life images. In this Guardian article, Nesrine Malik writes about the uncomfortable mashup of AI and real images on social media in particular.</p>
<p>Malik explores the political sway that AI can hold over people. It is an inherently biased thing, producing images which are heteronormative and conservative. I’ve even noticed that AI search engines can at times show a tinge of opinion in answering a question, swaying in a more right-leaning bias. In her article, Malik writes about the sandwiching of AI imagery between real imagery, and how this turns all media sources into slop. </p>
<p>Describing the internet and digital media as “slop” feels incredibly accurate. There is already an incredibly large amount of media to consume, between all different social media and news platforms, and with AI’s advancements, that media is growing at an exponential rate. The same image can be reproduced and warped in hundreds of ways, and images that never existed now flood our feeds. The line between social media and news is blurring, as is the line between real and fake. We consume so much and at such a quick rate, that I think we are forgetting how to critically think about the media. Malik writes “Even when content is deeply serious, it is presented as entertainment or, as an intermission, in a sort of visual elevator music.” Images flash so quickly through our screen that we aren’t allowing ourselves the human instinct to analyze and form our own opinions – digital media is becoming slop, but so are we. </p>

<h3>Al Jazeera, Graphic Novel: Motherhood in Crisis</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I’m going to reflect on Heela’s story, titled “My stolen future”. In this story, Heela shares that she was raped by her boyfriend multiple times when she was young. She became pregnant, and unable to go forward with an abortion, gave birth to a baby boy. She writes about her desire to become a nurse, the very personal importance of healthcare after watching her mother die from Ebola, and her strained relationship with her father. This graphic novel combines illustrations with photography and video, though the photo and video don’t come till the end of the story. I was very moved by the photo of Heela writing which was overlaid with a drawing of her, the same character we’d been seeing up until then. Showing both Heela and the drawing of her in the same image is very successful in making this story much more real to the readers. Additionally, a video of Heela speaking is shown which literally gives a voice to the story. I think that graphic novels can be really effective because they’re easily digestible, but combining other forms of media takes a serious matter like this story and emphasizes that.

<h3>W.J Hennigan, The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</h3>
<p>When I first opened this link, I was surprised by the layout. I read articles by The Times very frequently, and am used to the regular format: a bolded title, a photo related to the topic, and a credited author, often accompanied by a small B&W headshot. </p>
<p>The article opens to a deep maroon and black page, with a slight and eerie pulsing motion. Simply displaying an all caps text that reads, “The risk of nuclear conflict is rising,” readers are not necessarily prompted to continue scrolling or reading. But still, the instinct is there. As you scroll, you realize these first few sentences are similar to that of a forward in a book, and you are met with the title: The Brink. </p>
<p>After scrolling a bit further, you find yourself in the normal, expected layout of a New York Times article. Sitting with the initial introduction, the message of this article has an emphasized importance. The article continues to use elements of graphic design to engage the reader, to place the reader into the conflict its covering.</p>
<p>Something that I found really effective with this method is the space between sentences. Articles and academic writing can be lengthy and lose peoples’ attention quite quickly. Leaving empty space around a sentence forces readers to sit with what it says, really consider it. Pairing this with graphics that literally physically move the reader through the scenario of the launch of a nuclear weapon is effective in a similar way that a photo could be – but without using photos of real people suffering, which has its own criticisms. 
</p>
<p>I’ve always felt that visuals are incredibly strong tools in storytelling, and it’s interesting to see a combination of photography and graphic design being used in tandem with text. This article was fully engaging because of that, and I think that’s really beneficial when writing on such heavy and important topics.
